# BazaarPlusPlus — Durable Memory

What an agent cannot recover by reading the code in front of it: domain invariants, the decisions already settled, and the traps that fail silently. Structure is in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), rationale in [adr/](adr/), process in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) — linked, never restated.

## Rules

Domain constraints that must stay true in the system.

- MessagePack-serialized DTOs in the Unity/Mono runtime must keep their whole serialized graph `public`.
- Key game entities (cards, merchants, trainers) by their stable template GUID, never by display name or `ArtKey` substring. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/Cards/PackageIdentity.cs`]
- Package-card identity is `EHiddenTag.Package` only, resolved via `PackageIdentity.IsPackage` — never name or `ArtKey` heuristics. Nine call sites across Collection classification and the package-merchant tooltip depend on that single resolver. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/Cards/PackageIdentity.cs`]
- Bump both `RunLogSchema` version constants together when the persisted graph changes; there is no separate upload-payload version. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus.Storage/RunLog/RunLogSchema.cs` | ADR-0007]
- The mod carries **no play policy**: transport and validation only. All agent strategy lives in the external `bazaarplusplus-agent`. [ADR-0002]
- The BazaarAgent external contract is v3 — `GET /v3/context` and `POST /v3/actions` are the only decision routes. Wire field names and delta-merge semantics are pinned in `src/BazaarPlusPlus.BazaarAgent/AGENT_README.md`; keep that file in step with the projector. [ADR-0002 | ADR-0003]
- Harmony patches apply per patch class — never revert to `PatchAll()`. One broken game target must degrade only its own feature, not abort the whole plugin. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Plugin.cs` | ARCHITECTURE.md]
- CJK text that renders as tofu is routed through `NativeGameTypography`, which applies the game's native serif/sans and extends BPP-owned text with a CJK fallback chain. Fix the font route, not the copy. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/Fonts/NativeGameTypography.cs`]
- Mod-authored user-facing strings use `LocalizedTextSet` (en + zh-Hans, optional zh-Hant + de/pt/ko/it; anything else falls back to English). [`src/BazaarPlusPlus.Localization/LocalizedTextSet.cs`]

## Architecture decisions

One line each, full record in [adr/](adr/). A line here exists to stop a settled question from being reopened; the ADR says why.

- ADR-0001: Expose run/encounter state via on-demand `IEncounterStateProbe`, not an event-sourced timeline tracker.
- ADR-0002: BazaarAgent is its own BepInEx plugin depending on BazaarPlusPlus — dependency inverted, fixed loopback `127.0.0.1:47900`.
- ADR-0003: Replay exit is explicit and single-owner. The V1 replay-control endpoints were removed; the agent `Continue` Flow action is emitted only at `finishedAwaitingContinue`, and `CombatReplayRuntime.TryContinueReplay` is the only programmatic `ReplayState` exit.
- ADR-0004: Keep behavior-specific seams and reject cosmetic unifications — the three Core seams, HistoryPanel async/state ownership, distinct tooltip normalizers, catalog-local facet snapshots, evidence-free registration-order rules.
- ADR-0005: One Collection `Destroy` chip covers the whole destroy-mechanic cluster on base templates; `TTriggerOnCardRepaired` is deliberately excluded.
- ADR-0006: Timing invariants live in pure decision cores, not MonoBehaviour glue. Staged start commits, the two-phase exit decision, the single-owner suppression latch, the null-outcome no-op, and the two-point dispose contract are load-bearing.
- ADR-0007: Outbound Mod API rules have protocol and persistence owners — one Run Bundle contract, one response parser, session-owned transport, a pure seal-convergence core, a Storage-owned bundle queue.
- ADR-0008: Remote data separates runtime catalogs, the release manifest, and build-time seed fetch into three lifecycles.
- ADR-0009: Combat Impact numbers are ledger entries — dimension/basis/coverage/provenance on every value, per-view conservation only, typed residuals never dropped, activation batches are observations (not trigger counts), attribution graph-driven (never card-GUID constants).

## Durable knowledge

Facts that take more than one file to derive, and that ARCHITECTURE does not state.

- CollectionPanel source filtering runs off the embedded `collection-sources.json` at `ExpectedSchemaVersion` 4, and the catalog size is pinned by test at 73 sources / 50 merchants / 23 trainers — adding a source means updating that expectation too. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/CollectionPanel/Sources/CollectionSourceCatalog.cs` | `tests/CollectionSourceFiltering.Tests/Program.cs`]
- There is exactly one upload feed and one `BackgroundUploadPump`. Settings rows arm attempts through the `UploadArmRequested` bus event; there is deliberately no static feed registry, and the per-feature upload controllers it replaced are not coming back. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/Upload/IUploadFeed.cs` | ADR-0006]
- The cloud backend (uploads, ghost battles, BazaarDB snapshots) lives in the separate `bazaarplusplus-server` repo behind `mod-api-v4.bazaarplusplus.com`. Its behavior is **not** verifiable from this repo — treat server-side claims as unconfirmed until checked there.

## Patterns

Reach for these before writing a new one.

- Reuse the game's native UI components (`CardPreviewBase.SetUp` and the like) and existing prior art instead of hand-rolling a render or upload chain.
- Mod-appended tooltip text goes through `BppTooltipSections`, which clones the tooltip's own passive-text block at 0.75 font scale, keyed per controller and purpose. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Patches/Tooltips/BppTooltipSections.cs`]
- Keep Unity-adjacent logic free of Unity types and Compile-Include it into a test project — no InternalsVisibleTo needed. `OverlayLifecycleCore`, `HotkeyBindingPathCore`, `AsyncLoadCache`, `CollectionCardFitMath`, and `SavedReplayLifecycle` reach zero-ManagedPath. `CollectionViewState` does not: it uses `BazaarGameShared` types, so its test project still references the game assemblies. [ADR-0006]
- To read a replay outside Unity, decode through `CombatReplayPayloadStore` plus `MessagePackSerializer.Deserialize<NetMessageGameSim/NetMessageCombatSim>` with `MessagePackConfig.Options`. `CombatReplayLoader` returns an Assembly-CSharp type, so it only works inside the game process.

## Gotchas

Each of these failed silently, or reported something misleading, at least once.

- Runtime `Card` tags do not carry static template tags — hidden *and* public (`DTOUtils.CreateCard` never copies them and snapshot updates overwrite) — derive identity from template tags and static data, merging runtime+template+enchantment as `CombatImpactEntityTags` does. [`decompiled/TheBazaarRuntime/TheBazaar/DTOUtils.cs` | `src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/PostCombatImpact/Data/CombatImpactEntityTags.cs`]
- Static-data lookup is fallible on degraded and test paths: catch and return a safe default, as the current resolvers do. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/Encounter/EncounterTypeResolver.cs`]
- Rendering the reused uGUI card prefab through an offscreen camera into a `RenderTexture` silently yields an empty texture under URP — native board previews stay on the `ScreenSpaceOverlay` canvas; do not re-propose the RT path. [architecture/panels.md]
- A Harmony postfix on an `async Task` game method runs at the first await suspension, not at completion — bind pre-state in a **prefix**.
- `PublicizeAll` makes `ConfigEntry<T>.SettingChanged` ambiguous (CS0229), so no BPP code subscribes to it; invalidate config-derived caches by raw-value compare. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/Input/BppHotkeyService.cs`]
- The BPP hotkey conflict check compares BPP actions only against other BPP actions, never native `Gameplay/*` bindings. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/Input/BppHotkeyService.cs`]
- Panel toggle hotkeys are filtered per registration by `HotkeyGuard`, where returning false swallows the press. HistoryPanel deliberately will not close while a text field is focused. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/OverlayPanels/OverlayPanelHost.cs` | `Game/HistoryPanel/HistoryPanel.cs`]
- BazaarDB link: `OnPanelShown` must reset `AccountLinkInProgress`. `_session.Begin()` cancels in-flight redeems whose continuations bail on `!IsCurrent` without resetting state, and a re-entrant open skips `OnPanelHidden` — otherwise the link row goes permanently inert. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/HistoryPanel/HistoryPanelCoordinator.cs`]
- VoiceSubtitles labels clone the donor label's font and material and must keep `TextWrappingModes.Normal` + `TextOverflowModes.Overflow`. NoWrap+Ellipsis at a scaled font hits TMP's `m_characterCount == 0` branch and the whole subtitle block disappears. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/VoiceSubtitles/VoiceLineDisplay.cs`]
- Pooled native tooltip clones share one root-canvas `sortingOrder`, and `overrideSorting` cannot be set on a root canvas. Layering a BPP preview above the other (locked) clone means raising this clone's root-canvas order while visible, refcounted per owner; sibling order inside the prefab is irrelevant. This bug class recurred three times. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Patches/Tooltips/ItemEnchantPreviewTooltipLayerPatch.cs`]
- The only working concealment seam for the native auxiliary tooltip is the `auxParent` CanvasGroup gate: `Tooltip_Aux_P`'s `auxParent` owns the complete visual tree, and a CanvasGroup on the controller root sits above the prefab's nested Canvas — silently inert. Teardown keeps the gate closed; owned gates `DestroyImmediate` on restore, since a deferred destroy leaves an end-of-frame corpse that `GetComponent` adopts and silently ungates. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/Tooltips/NativePairedTooltipHost.cs` | `tests/NativePairedTooltipHost.Tests/`]
- Native `ShowAuxiliaryTooltipController` only `SetText`s — it never reactivates header/body, so a pooled controller handed back with inactive text nodes collapses to a tiny empty frame over the board. The show handoff force-reactivates requested nodes; a frame audit conceals `visible_without_text` leftovers. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/Tooltips/NativePairedTooltipHost.cs`]
- Locking a native card tooltip (`SetLockedFlag(true)`) re-enables `blocksRaycasts` via `ToggleInteractabilityOnCanvas`; a tooltip overlapping the pointer then steals hover, and the synthetic `PointerExit` yields a show/hide flicker loop. Keep the lock but force raycasts off while BPP owns the controller. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/PostCombatImpact/PostCombatImpactController.cs` | `src/BazaarPlusPlus/Patches/PostCombatImpact/PostCombatImpactRecapPatch.cs`]
- UI Toolkit `Button` inherits `TextElement`, so `Q<TextElement>()` returns the button itself when no separate label exists — hiding that "label" hides the whole control (guard with `!ReferenceEquals`), and a refresh writing `Button.text` resurrects the native label beside a custom one. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/CollectionPanel/Ui/CollectionPanelView.Filters.cs`]
- The hardcoded `DayTierSchedule` was removed and its absence is pinned by architecture tests — do not restore it as a fallback. Day tiers resolve through `GameDataDayTierResolver`, whose success cache is keyed on `JsonGameDataManager` reference identity because the game swaps that reference after a GameData download. `MaximumTier` means the highest usable Bronze-to-Diamond tier, not the largest probability. Collection fails open when the table is unavailable. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/DayTiers/GameDataDayTierResolver.cs` | `tests/Architecture.Tests/CoreLayeringTests.cs`]
- Source-shadow scenario capsules pin production files through explicit Compile-Include and may define mutually incompatible runtime shims. Keep them in the closed `BppScenarioRunnerProjects` list and execute them only through the process-isolated `ScenarioRunner.Tests` host. [`Directory.Build.props` | `tests/ScenarioRunner.Tests/`]
- Architecture-test file sweeps (absence assertions, reference scans) must enumerate from the `src/` and `tests/` roots, never recurse from the repo root — embedded worktrees such as `.claude/worktrees/` hold stale checkouts that still contain removed code and turn the sweep red. [`tests/Architecture.Tests/CoreLayeringTests.cs`]
- `CombatReplayPayloadStore`/`GhostBattlePayloadStore` class and method names, ctor arity, and file suffixes are reflection-pinned by process-isolated scenario capsules. Keep the named facades over `FileBackedPayloadStore<T>`; renaming compiles and then fails at runtime. [`tests/CombatReplayRecording.Tests/Program.cs` | `tests/GhostBattleSync.Tests/Program.cs`]
- Portrait providers negative-cache exceptions past their service-readiness gates, so one transient asset-load exception caches a null portrait until restart. Preserved by design through the `AsyncLoadCache` migration — changing it is a behavior change. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/HeroPortraits/`]
- Synthetic or unknown GUIDs must not repeatedly reach native-preview template lookup; the grid negative-caches `TemplateUnavailable` per catalog generation. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/CardPreview/NativeCardPreviewFactory.cs`]
- Dock-button lifecycle controllers must live on the always-active native button, never a `SetActive(false)` clone — inactive clones get no `LateUpdate` and miss later state transitions. Position dock tooltips through the native `AuxiliaryTooltipController.PositionOverUI`, not its world-space coroutine. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/CombatReplay/CurrentReplayRecordingButtonController.cs`]
- Clone the controller-free native donor first, then attach the BPP MonoBehaviour to the stable owner — cloning a GameObject that already carries a BPP controller duplicates the controller. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/CombatReplay/CurrentReplayRecordingButtonController.cs`]
- BPP settings dock buttons are clones of native dock buttons that must avoid native-button bounds and re-sync geometry for several frames after a screen-size change. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/Settings/BppDockButtonVisuals.cs`]
- Aspect-fallback collection cards (no measurable frame or raw-image bounds) hold size via a one-shot `SetSizeWithCurrentAnchors` plus the per-cell bounds cache. This path shipped without in-game smoke; on card-size drift, apply the fallback documented in the fitter header. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/CollectionPanel/Grid/NativeCardCellFitter.cs`]
- The native end-of-run reveal uses `CreateRawGraph`, whose delay roots have no `ScriptPlayableOutput` and therefore never complete — cards stay FaceDown and screenshot readiness never fires. `EndOfRunRawRevealCompletionPatch` injects a port-1 output per root; keep it. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Patches/EndOfRun/EndOfRunRawRevealCompletionPatch.cs`]
- `BackgroundUploadPump.OnDestroy` is a two-point dispose: release arm subscriptions first, dispose the session only after the drain callback. Merging them lets an in-flight `RunAttemptAsync` hit disposed resources. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/Upload/BackgroundUploadPump.cs` | ADR-0006]
- `HistoryPanelDependencies`' single ctor stays guard-free direct assignment: scenario capsules construct it with positional nulls as pinned behavior anchors, so adding null guards breaks them at construction. [`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Game/HistoryPanel/HistoryPanelDependencies.cs` | ADR-0004]
- `run.sh` defaults `DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_DISABLEIPV6=1`, override-preserving, so unusable advertised IPv6 routes cannot stall build-time downloads. [`run.sh`]
