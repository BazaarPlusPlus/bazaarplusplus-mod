# BazaarPlusPlus Architecture

How the plugin is assembled: startup and teardown order, the layer and assembly boundaries, the seams that more than one feature consumes, and where runtime data lives. Per-feature detail is disclosed under [architecture/](architecture/) — this file covers only what holds across features.

Terms used here are defined in [../CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md). Why a boundary is where it is lives in [adr/](adr/).

## Runtime Shape

`Plugin.Awake()` resolves the game build channel via `GameBuildInfoResolver`, creates `BppComposition`, installs static facades such as `BppLog`, `BppPatchHost`, localization, settings dock entries, supporters, and hotkeys, applies Harmony patches per patch class, starts feature modules, builds the owner-scoped Mod API session and separate BazaarDB-link client, then mounts Unity components onto the plugin `GameObject` (`src/BazaarPlusPlus/Plugin.cs`).

`BppComposition` is the manual composition root — there is no DI container. It receives the resolved `IGameBuildInfo` and wires feature modules through `BppFeatureRegistry`, Unity components through `BppMountableRegistry`, and in-game settings rows through `SettingsDockEntryRegistry` (`src/BazaarPlusPlus/BppComposition.cs`). Simple components mount through `ComponentMount<T>`; a bespoke mount exists only where a feature owns additional dependencies or object lifecycles, and `CombatReplayRuntime` is the bootstrap exception because other modules need it before mountables run. It also publishes the passive BazaarAgent game facades through `BazaarAgentGameBridge`, so the optional host plugin can consume them without the main plugin referencing the agent core.

Three ordering facts in this file are load-bearing, because each one fails silently when reordered:

- **Patches apply per class** via `CreateClassProcessor(type).Patch()`, never `PatchAll()`. One broken game target — a game update, a PTR branch — then degrades only its own feature instead of aborting the whole plugin.
- **Teardown unmounts Unity components, disposes the composition (stopping pure features in reverse registration order), and only then destroys `CombatReplayRuntime`.** That lets Run Logging settle a deferred completion while replay persistence state is still readable.
- **The run-log database is released only after every writer is gone.** Microsoft.Data.Sqlite pools connections, so without an explicit release the native handle, the `-wal`/`-shm` files, and an uncheckpointed WAL all survive the process, and the installer would have to recover the database rather than read it. `SqliteShutdown.ReleaseRunLogDatabase` clears the pool, truncates the WAL, and clears again (`src/BazaarPlusPlus.Storage/Sqlite/SqliteShutdown.cs`). Static teardown then releases native font handles, scopes, and cloned font assets through `NativeGameTypography.Reset()`.

## Game Build Channel And PTR Isolation

`GameBuildInfoResolver` classifies the running client as Online, Ptr, or Unknown from the bundleVersion `-ptr` token plus a corroborating `TheBazaar.Config.ServerOption` type probe (`src/BazaarPlusPlus/GameInterop/GameBuildInfoResolver.cs`).

Disagreement resolves to **Ptr**, and the asymmetry is the whole reason: classifying a PTR client as Online silently pollutes the production dataset and cannot be undone, while classifying an Online client as Ptr only pauses its uploads. The channel is injected into the composition, stamped onto recorded runs by `RunLoggingModule`, and `BundleSealCoordinator` excludes PTR runs before a bundle can enter the outbox.

Newer-only combat events and enum members stay behind runtime adapters in `GameInterop/CombatSimulation`, so a Production build lacking them skips only the optional metrics. Premise tests live in `tests/PtrCompatibility.Tests/`.

## Assemblies And Boundaries

Four assemblies ship unconditionally; two more ship only with `./run.sh build --with-bazaaragent`.

| Assembly | Contents |
|---|---|
| `BazaarPlusPlus.dll` | the BepInEx plugin: Unity/game integration, feature modules, Harmony patches, embedded resources, composition root |
| `BazaarPlusPlus.ModApi.dll` | HTTP client, routes, DTOs, MessagePack/gzip helpers for the mod backend |
| `BazaarPlusPlus.Storage.dll` | SQLite schema, repositories, path interfaces, local persistence models |
| `BazaarPlusPlus.Localization.dll` | localization resolution engine, language and mode helpers |
| `BazaarPlusPlus.BazaarAgent.dll` (optional) | pure HTTP transport, action DTOs, validation, queues, runtime controller |
| `BazaarPlusPlus.BazaarAgentHost.dll` (optional) | separate BepInEx plugin that reads `BazaarAgentGameBridge` and pumps the controller from Unity lifecycle methods |

`ModApi`, `Storage`, and `Localization` keep **zero game, Unity, and BepInEx references**, and the BazaarAgent pure core keeps to `System` + `Newtonsoft.Json`. Both invariants are enforced by architecture tests, not by the compiler.

Inside the main assembly:

| Directory | Owns |
|---|---|
| `Core/` | pure mod abstractions: config, event bus, runtime service interfaces, run context, path contracts, the run-snapshot contract |
| `GameInterop/` | adapters over game, Unity, or publicized runtime surfaces |
| `Game/` | feature workflows, UI, user-facing policy, filtering, upload orchestration, storage use |
| `Patches/` | Harmony patches, reaching services through `BppPatchHost` rather than constructor injection |
| `Infrastructure/` | cross-cutting logging, UI tokens, stable text helpers, generic seams |

The main project targets `netstandard2.1`, uses C# 12, and publicizes game assemblies, so `internal` game members are accessible. Remote seed data is declared in `RemoteEmbeddedData.targets` and delegates transport to `build/RemoteEmbeddedDataFetcher`; the shared version is `BppVersion` in `Directory.Build.props`.

Architecture tests ratchet dependency boundaries, shared ownership, BazaarAgent isolation, and test/build safety contracts (`tests/Architecture.Tests/`). Concrete composition behavior remains in `tests/CompositionRuntime.Tests/` and is compiled by `RuntimeIntegration.Tests`: feature start/stop is fault-isolated, while `BppMountableRegistry.MountAll` deliberately is not.

## Shared Seams

Each of these is consumed by two or more features. Reaching around one to re-implement its behavior inside a feature is the failure this section exists to prevent.

| Seam | Owner | Consumers |
|---|---|---|
| Overlay panel lifecycle | `Game/OverlayPanels/OverlayPanelHost.cs` | Collection, History, LiveBuild |
| Native card preview | `GameInterop/CardPreview/` | Collection, item boards |
| Native tooltip suppression | `GameInterop/Tooltips/NativeTooltipSuppression` | replay recording, end-of-run capture |
| Item board rendering | `GameInterop/ItemBoardPreview/` | History, LiveBuild |
| Day tier resolution | `GameInterop/DayTiers/` | Collection's Day gate, Encounter Preview |
| Hero portraits | `GameInterop/HeroPortraits/` | History, LiveBuild, ghost rows |
| Text rendering | `GameInterop/Fonts/NativeGameTypography` | every BPP surface |
| Remote embedded catalogs | `Infrastructure/RemoteEmbeddedCatalog/` | voice lines, ten-win builds, supporters |
| Atomic payload files | `Infrastructure/` `FileBackedPayloadStore<T>` | combat replay, ghost payloads |
| Deduped async loads | `Infrastructure/` `AsyncLoadCache<TKey,TValue>` | hero and encounter portrait providers |

`RemoteEmbeddedCatalog<T>` owns cache → embedded → remote loading with feature-supplied freshness: single-flight warm and refresh, per-caller cancellation over shared flights, typed outcomes, atomic cache writes, retry re-arming, monotonic publication, and generation-guarded disposal. A queued cold-start refresh takes ownership atomically when its refresh flight begins, so cancelling the originating warm flight before that handoff prevents the remote operation. Feature observers are serialized against disposal on a separate gate, so `TryGet` never waits for feature-side logging or index rebuilds.

Operational logging is governed: features emit through closed `BppLogFeatureScope`s with dotted-snake event ids and typed privacy/cardinality/correlation fields, declared in per-feature `[BppLogEventSource]` `*LogEvents` classes that `BppLogEventCatalog` discovers and validates. Debug events compile out of Release. Ratcheted by `tests/Architecture.Tests/LoggingGovernanceTests.cs`.

## Data And File Locations

Runtime data that BazaarPlusPlus owns is rooted at `<GameRoot>/BazaarPlusPlusV5/`. `BepInExPathProvider` exposes that single root, and storage and feature modules derive the SQLite database, bundle outbox, replay, ghost payload, screenshot, video, voice, LiveBuild, supporter, Encounter Preview, and BazaarAgent paths from it. No runtime cache uses the process temporary directory.

V5 uses a fresh, non-migrating SQLite schema. Beyond run facts, events, battles, snapshots, screenshots, and replay-video metadata it holds `bundle_seal_jobs` and a non-FK `bundle_outbox`; ghost rows carry remote bundle identity, presigned URL and expiry, and replay state. V4 sync cursors, dirty/checkpoint upload state, and independent screenshot upload state do not exist (`src/BazaarPlusPlus.Storage/RunLog/RunLogSchema.cs`).

## Event Flow

An in-memory event bus decouples runtime coordination between feature modules registered at startup (`src/BazaarPlusPlus/BppComposition.cs` — the `Register` call order is the authoritative roster).

`RunLoggingModule` is the feature-owned event intake. `Start` creates its replicated/queued store chain and session manager only after composition construction succeeds, subscribes once to run lifecycle, run initialization, PvP recording, and replay-drained events, then maps a matching `PVPCombat` manifest directly to persistence. Battles attach to the stable active or deferred run id before the event append and checkpoint. Interrupted runs stay resumable; normal completion owns an active, cancellable two-second replay-persistence deadline; `Stop` is a quiescence barrier that forces any deferred completion before unsubscribing and disposing the store. No Run Logging `MonoBehaviour` is mounted.

PvP battle evidence is a shared `Game/PvpBattles` module rather than a `GameInterop` adapter — it captures local and opponent identities and board snapshots from live game state and net messages.

## BazaarAgent Optional Host

BazaarAgent is optional and off by default. The host plugin declares `[BepInDependency(BppPluginMetadata.Guid)]`, reads `BazaarAgentGameBridge.Current`, creates a pure runtime controller, pumps it from `Update()`, and disposes it on destroy. It listens only on loopback at the fixed `127.0.0.1:47900`, serving `GET /v3/context`, `POST /v3/actions`, and a read-only activity browser under `GET /` and `GET /dashboard/`.

The v3 wire protocol — session and revision handshake, delta merge semantics, item reference format, action fields — is documented in `src/BazaarPlusPlus.BazaarAgent/AGENT_README.md`, next to the projector that implements it. That file is the contract; this one does not restate it.
